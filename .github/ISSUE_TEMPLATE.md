Submit a new issue only if you are sure it is a missing feature or a bug. Otherwise use the [discussion section](https://github.com/komoot/photon/discussions). 

The best way to get help about a Photon issue is to create a valid and detailed issue content, preferable with a unit or integration test reproducing the issue. Please include the version of Photon, the JVM and the operating system are you using and in case of a geocoding problem include a link to [komoot's photon instance](https://photon.komoot.io/). Also tell us your expected geocoding result.

**Do not post screenshots** of commandline output or search results. Please copy the output into the issue instead.
